(Some notes...)

Images:
    FuzzImage:
        Works as a golden image for docker swarm machines
        Contains all required components to run as a docker swarm-master, or as a swarm-node
        In initialization N swarm-machine instances are created from FuzzImage, one of them is selected as a swarm-master, by Bastion

        Can be used in Google Compute Preemptible instances and Amazon Spot Instances.

        swarm-master:
            Uses docker-machine to set up docker-swarm, including all swarm-machine instances
            Runs docker swarm discovery service
            Distributes fuzzing jobs, once recieved from Bastion

        swarm-node:
            Runs fuzzing docker container(s)
            Syncs results with Bastion
                *Time interval
                *Preemptible and SpotInstance shutdown detection


    Bastion:
        Works as a SSH gateway between outside world and fuzzing cluster
        Delivers docker image from user to swarm-machines
        Stores results


FuzzImage:

    OS: Ubuntu 16.04

    Contains:
        docker.io
        docker-machine
        swarm
        swarm discovery service (runs only on swarm-master)
        scripts for results syncing
        ssh
        rsync

Bastion:
    OS: Ubuntu 16.04

    Contains:
        ssh
        scripts for swarm-master control
        scripts for docker images distribution

Note: User should be able to run whole, or at least partial, implementation on local machine, without too large overhead.
